# J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research Virtual Experience

This repository showcases my completion of the **J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program** offered on **Forage**, where I gained hands-on exposure to **financial modeling, risk analysis, and predictive modeling** used in real-world banking and trading environments.

---

## üìò Overview

Through this program, I worked as a **Quantitative Researcher** supporting different teams ‚Äî from commodity trading to retail and mortgage risk analysis. The experience involved building pricing models, performing risk assessments, and applying statistical and machine learning methods to financial datasets.

## üíº Tasks & Deliverables

### **Task 1 -  Investigate and analyze price data**
- Collaborated with a **commodity trading desk** to improve the granularity of natural gas price data.  
- **Analyzed seasonal trends** and historical pricing patterns to extrapolate future gas prices.  
- Provided insights that enable more accurate pricing of **natural gas storage contracts**.

### **Task 2 ‚Äì Price a commodity storage contract**
- Developed a **Python-based pricing script** for natural gas storage contracts.  
- Calculated contract value considering **purchase price, selling price, storage fees, and logistics costs**.  
- Modeled seasonal arbitrage opportunities such as **buying in summer and selling in winter**.  
- Demonstrated understanding of **cost of carry, storage valuation, and pricing differentials**.

### **Task 3 ‚Äì Credit risk analysis**
- Assisted the **retail banking risk team** in predicting customer loan defaults.  
- Built a **prototype predictive model** to estimate **probability of default (PD)** based on customer data.  
- Improved capital adequacy planning by forecasting potential loan losses.  
- Applied **supervised machine learning** and **statistical risk estimation** techniques.

### **Task 4 ‚Äì Bucket FICO scores**
- Worked on the **mortgage portfolio** to predict default probabilities using FICO scores.  
- Designed an approach to **convert continuous FICO scores into categorical variables** suitable for ML models.  
- Used **dynamic programming** to optimize score bucketing and improve prediction accuracy.  
- Enhanced interpretability for risk management teams and model integration.
